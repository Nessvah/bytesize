# bytesize
Playing with the byte sizes in C

Sizeof is a much used operator in the C or C++. It is a compile time unary operator which can be used to compute the size of it's operand. 
The result of sizeof is of unsigned integral type which is usually denoted by size_t. sizeof can be applied to any data-type, including primitive 
types such as integer and floating-point types, pointer types, or compound datatypes such as Structure, union etc.

sizeof() operator is used in different way according to the operand type. 
 

In this program I use sizeof when the operand is a Data Type. It will simply return the amount of memory is allocated to that data types.

Note: sizeof() may give different output according to machine you are using.
